And I'm good at it too!! It sounds cliche, but it really is more than just a job, it's a passion.

### *I love writing code and I love solving problems!!*

Taking an idea and turning it into a concrete functioning piece of software is fun.  Refactoring buggy code (even if sometimes it's mine) and making it performant are pretty cool tools to have in your belt.

### *A rising tide lifts all boats*

I've always considered myself a *lifelong student*. Listening to the ideas of others and those who *think differently* than me has helped me grow.  I also think being able to teach concepts is important. Whether it's *professor mode* or *teach by example*, helping others grow is just good karma.
